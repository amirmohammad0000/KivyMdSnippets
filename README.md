# KivyMd-Snippets;



I was working with Kiwi and as you all know IDE PyCharm can not support kivy and highlight kivy code so I searched in Google and after searching in Google I found this address
https://github.com/amirmohammad0000/kivybits/blob/master/IDE/PyCharm_kv_completion.jar;



There is a file in this address that by importing that file in PyCharm you can have highlighted kivy code with your PyCharm IDE, but the problem was that this file is only for kivy and can not highlight your KivyMD code;



For this reason, inspired by kivy lang, which is available at this address https://github.com/amirmohammad0000/kivybits/blob/master/IDE/PyCharm_kv_completion.jar,
I created a new thing and named it kivyMd lang And is available at this address https://github.com/amirmohammad0000/KivyMd-Snippets/blob/main/PyCharm_kvmd_completion.jar.
It also highlights and supports all kivyMd code;



For example, with kivy lang you can create a Label and the program will highlight the word Label for you, but if you write MDLabel KivyLang can not highlight this word for you, so I created kivyMD Lang to be able to add kivy from the code Support kivyMD and highlight all your kivyMD code;



I have put all the kivyMd code in this file and this plugin can support all kivyMd code so if you see a bug or this plugin could not support the code that is available in kivyMD, message this email "koshkian1000@gmail.com" and fix the problem Tell me, and if you see that code inside the KivyMD site, give me the address of that page and tell me which code is not supported or what is the problem. So if you see a problem, be sure to contact me and tell me where the problem is so that we can create a very good plugin with our help;
